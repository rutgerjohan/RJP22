                <p>
                    Hello! I am Rutger. After finishing my HAVO (Senior general secundairy education in The Netherlands) I started studying Communication and Multimedia Design at The Hague University of Applied Sciences. 
                    <br></br>
                    Here I started learning about Visual Design (UI/UX) and the basics of Front end developement (HTML/CSS/JS). I soon found my passion for design and was very lucky to work with others that inspired me and helped me when I needed it the most.
                    <br></br>
                    I'm currently in my third year which means I'm still looking for an internship starting february 2023.

                <h3>Some personal information</h3>
                <p>
                    Sometimes it can be difficult for me to translates the ideas in my brain to words. That's why i like to use my creativity and art to convey a message!
                    <br></br>
                    And since you are reading this secret hidden message right now i guess that works!
                    <br></br>
                    Oh btw. My logo is an umbrella because in the Netherlands the weather can be very uncertain which means you always have to guess as to when to bring your umbrella.

                <h3>How I work.</h3>
                <p>
                    My workflow is usually based on Think, Make, Break, Repeat. Let me explain!
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    -1-
                    <br>
                    First, make sure you understand the problem. Speak with the people you design for and get to know what they need/want.
                    <br></br>

                    -2-
                    <br>
                    After understanding the problems you can start thinking about the solutions. Make sketches, Lofi's, Hifi's and start testing with the target audience. Repeat this untill you find a solution that fits best!
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    With my passionate and enthusiastic approach I have been lucky to work on some awesome projects. If you want to know more about my projects you can check it out <a href="../RJP22/work.html">here</a>.
